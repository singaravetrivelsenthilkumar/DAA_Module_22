# EX 4A DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING - 1
## DATE:
## AIM:
To find longest common subsequence using Dynamic Programming.



## Algorithm
1. Define function lcs(str1, str2) to find the length of the Longest Common Subsequence.
2. Get the lengths m and n of the two input strings.
3. Create a 2D list matrix of size (m+1) x (n+1) initialized with zeros.
4. Loop through all indices i from 0 to m and j from 0 to n. 
5. If i == 0 or j == 0, set matrix[i][j] = 0 (base case of empty substring).
6. If characters str1[i-1] == str2[j-1], set matrix[i][j] = 1 + matrix[i-1][j-1].
7. Otherwise, set matrix[i][j] = max(matrix[i-1][j], matrix[i][j-1]).
8. After filling the matrix, return the value at matrix[m][n] which is the LCS length.
9. Read two input strings str1 and str2 from the user.
10. Call the lcs function and store the result in lcs_length.

                matrix[i][j] = 0
            elif str1[i-1] == str2[j-1]:
                matrix[i][j] = 1 + matrix[i-1][j-1]
            else:
                matrix[i][j] = max(matrix[i-1][j] , matrix[i][j-1])
    return matrix[-1][-1]
str1 = input()
str2 = input()
lcs_length = lcs(str1, str2)
print("Length of LCS is : {}".format(lcs_length))
